## üöÄ Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the power of large language models with external data sources. In this repo, Azure Cognitive Search is used to search specific documents and provide relevant context to the AI model for more accurate and grounded answers.  
**Keywords:** Azure AI, RAG, Cognitive Search, OpenAI, Document Intelligence, PDF OCR, Table Extraction, AI Chatbot, Multi-Agent, Enterprise Search.

---   

## üìÅ Structure

- **Python:** [`test.py`](test.py)  
  Uses the `openai` and `azure.identity` libraries to connect to Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search. Reads configuration from [`Appkey.txt`](Appkey.txt) and demonstrates how to send a chat completion request with data augmentation from Azure Search.

- **C#:** [`CSharp/Program.cs`](CSharp/Program.cs)  
  Uses Azure SDKs (`Azure.AI.OpenAI`, `Azure.Search.Documents`) to perform a search and send the results as context to the OpenAI model.

  **Required NuGet Packages:**
  - `Azure.AI.OpenAI`
  - `Azure.Search.Documents`
  - `Azure.Core`
  - `OpenAI` (for `OpenAI.Chat` if used)

  You can install these packages using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or with the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

  ```powershell
  Install-Package Azure.AI.OpenAI
  Install-Package Azure.Search.Documents
  Install-Package Azure.Core
  Install-Package OpenAI
  ```
- **C++:** [`Cpp/AiTest/AiTest.cpp`](Cpp/AiTest/AiTest.cpp)  
  Uses `libcurl` for HTTP requests and `nlohmann/json` for JSON handling. Reads keys from [`Appkey.txt`](Appkey.txt), queries Azure Cognitive Search, and sends the context to Azure OpenAI.

  ### üõ†Ô∏è C++ Dependencies

  This project uses [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage C++ dependencies.

  **Install vcpkg:**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
  cd vcpkg
  .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat   # On Windows PowerShell
  ```

  **Install dependencies:**
  ```sh
  .\vcpkg.exe install curl nlohmann-json
  ```

  **Integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio (optional but recommended):**
  ```sh
  .\vcpkg.exe integrate install
  ```

  After installing, open your Visual Studio solution and ensure it uses the vcpkg toolchain or the installed packages.

## üìë Using Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer)

You can also use [Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/) to extract structured data from documents (PDFs, images, etc.) before indexing them in Azure Cognitive Search.

### How to Use Document Intelligence with This Repo

1. **Create a Document Intelligence Resource**
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Search for **Azure AI Document Intelligence** (or **Form Recognizer**) and create a new resource.
   - After deployment, open your resource and find the **Endpoint** and **Key** under the "Keys and Endpoint" section.

2. **Extract Data from Documents**
   - Use the [Azure.AI.FormRecognizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme) SDK (C#) or [azure-ai-formrecognizer](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-formrecognizer/) (Python) to extract text and fields from your documents.
   - Example (Python):
     ```python
     from azure.ai.formrecognizer import DocumentAnalysisClient
     from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

     endpoint = "<your-form-recognizer-endpoint>"
     key = "<your-form-recognizer-key>"
     document_path = "path/to/your/document.pdf"

     client = DocumentAnalysisClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(key))
     with open(document_path, "rb") as f:
         poller = client.begin_analyze_document("prebuilt-document", document=f)
         result = poller.result()
         for page in result.pages:
             print("Page content:", page.content)
     ```
   - You can extract the content and save it as text or JSON for indexing.

3. **Index Extracted Data in Azure Cognitive Search**
   - After extracting the content, upload it to your Azure Cognitive Search index (as shown in the setup steps above).
   - This allows you to search and ground your AI responses in the content of scanned documents, PDFs, and more.

---

## üìö Understanding the Azure Cognitive Search Index

An **index** in Azure Cognitive Search is similar to a database table: it defines the structure of your searchable data and stores the documents you want to search over. Each document in the index is like a row in a table, and each field is like a column.

### Why is the Index Important?

- The index determines what data you can search and retrieve.
- You must define the fields (such as `id` and `content`) before uploading documents.
- The `id` field is required and must be unique for each document. It acts as the primary key.

### How This Repo Uses the Index

- The repo expects an index with at least these fields:
  - `id` (string, key): A unique identifier for each document.
  - `content` (string): The full text extracted from your source (e.g., PDF, text file).
- When you upload data (from a PDF or text file), it is stored in the `content` field of the index.
- When you ask a question, the code searches the `content` field for relevant information.

### How to Create or Update the Index

- The code in this repo will automatically create the index if it does not exist, using the correct schema.
- If you want to create or manage the index manually:
  1. Go to your Azure Portal ‚Üí Cognitive Search ‚Üí Indexes.
  2. Click **+ Add Index**.
  3. Add a field named `id` (type: String, Key: Yes).
  4. Add a field named `content` (type: String, Searchable: Yes).
  5. Save the index.

**Note:**  
If you change the fields in your index, you may need to delete and recreate the index for the changes to take effect.

### Example Index Definition (C#)

```csharp
var definition = new SearchIndex(indexName)
{
    Fields =
    {
        new SimpleField("id", SearchFieldDataType.String) { IsKey = true, IsFilterable = true },
        new SearchableField("content") { IsSortable = false, IsFilterable = false }
    }
};
indexClient.CreateOrUpdateIndex(definition);
```

---

**In summary:**  
The index is the core of your search experience. Make sure it has the right fields, and always include an `id` when uploading documents. All search and retrieval in this repo is performed against the `content` field of your index.

**Tip:**  
Document Intelligence is especially useful for digitizing and searching large collections of scanned files, forms, or complex documents.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This repo is for demonstration purposes and does not include production-level error handling or security.
- Make sure your Azure Search index contains the documents you want to query.

## üìä Example: Estimation of Jewish Losses in World War II by Country

When you ask a question such as:

> "What are the estimated Jewish losses in World War II based on country?"

The system retrieves relevant information from your indexed documents and provides a grounded answer. For example, the response may include a table or summary like:

| Country         | Estimated Jewish Losses |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Poland          | ~3,000,000             |
| Soviet Union    | ~1,000,000             |
| Hungary         | ~569,000               |
| Romania         | ~287,000               |
| Germany         | ~165,000               |
| Czechoslovakia  | ~277,000               |
| Lithuania       | ~143,000               |
| Netherlands     | ~102,000               |
| France          | ~77,000                |
| Other countries | (various)              |

*These numbers are based on historical estimates and may vary by source.*

This demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can provide detailed, document-grounded answers to complex historical questions using Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI.

## ü§ñ Using Azure AI Agents for Multi-Task Document Analysis

<!--
Learn how to use Azure AI agents for parallel document processing, including image analysis, table extraction, and text summarization. This approach enables advanced document understanding and enterprise search solutions.
-->

Azure AI now supports the use of **agents**‚Äîspecialized components that can each handle a specific type of task within your AI workflow. This enables you to process and explore documents in parallel, assigning each agent a unique role, such as image analysis or table extraction.

### How to Use Agents in Azure AI

1. **Define Specialized Agents**
   - **Image Agent:** Detects and analyzes images within documents (e.g., extracting text from images or identifying objects).
   - **Table Agent:** Extracts and interprets tables, converting them into structured data for further analysis.
   - **Text Agent:** Handles general text extraction, summarization, or question answering.

2. **Configure Your Workflow**
   - Orchestrate these agents so that when a document is uploaded, each agent processes the relevant part:
     - The image agent scans for embedded images and runs OCR or image classification.
     - The table agent locates tables and parses their content.
     - The text agent summarizes or answers questions based on the extracted data.

3. **Parallel and Specialized Processing**
   - Agents can work in parallel, speeding up document analysis and enabling multi-modal understanding (text, tables, images) in a single workflow.
   - Each agent can be optimized or fine-tuned for its specific task, improving accuracy and efficiency.

4. **Integration with Azure AI Studio**
   - Use [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/) to configure, deploy, and monitor your agents.
   - You can chain agents together or trigger them based on document content.

### Example Use Case

When a user uploads a PDF containing both scanned images and tables:
- The **image agent** extracts text from images (using OCR).
- The **table agent** converts tables into structured data.
- The **text agent** summarizes the document or answers user questions using all extracted content.

This agent-based approach enables more accurate and comprehensive document analysis, leveraging the strengths of each specialized AI component.
